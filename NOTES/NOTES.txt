Redux
	Redux is a predictable state container for JS apps
Redux toolkit
	Redux toolkit is the official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development
		Abstract over the setup process
		Handle the most common use cases
		Include some useful utilities
	It is also intended to be the standard way to write Redux logic in your application
	Redux toolkit serves as an abstraction over redux. It hides the difficult parts ensuring you have a good developer experience
	
React-Redux
	React-Redux is the official Redux UI binding library for React
	
Three Core concepts in redux
	Store - Holds the state of your app
	Action - Describes what happened
	Reducer - Ties the store and actions together
	
	The global state of your application is stored as an object inside a single store
	The only way to change the state is to dispatch an action, an object that describes what happened
	To specify how the state tree is updated based on actions, you write pure reducers
		Reducer - (previousState, action) => newState
		
Actions
	The only way your application can interact with the store
	Carry some information from your app to the redux store
	Plain JS objects
	Have a type property that describes something that happened in the application
	The type property is typically defined as string constants
	
Reducers
	Specify how the app's state changes in response to actions sent to the store
	Function that accepts state and action as argument, and returns the next state of the application
		Reducer - (previousState, action) => newState

Redux store
	One store for the entire app
	Responsibilities
		Holds app state
		Allows access to state via getState()
		Allows state to be updated via dispatch(action)
		Registers listeners via subscribe(listener)
		Handles unregistering of listeners via the function returned by subscribe(listener)

Redux concerns
	Redux requires too much boilerplate code
		Action, Action object, Action creator, Switch statement in a reducer
	A lot of other packages have to be installed to work with redux
		Redux-thunk, Immer, Redux-devtools
